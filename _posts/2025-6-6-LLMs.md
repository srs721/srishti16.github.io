title: Learning RAG and LLMs and all the buzz words around!
---

As a part of my self-growth in career, I am:

- Using deeplearning.ai to leverage Andrew Ng's free courses
- Learning about how to build RAG pipelines and use vector databases with MongoDB as a part of prompt engineering.
- Exploring about AI models to not just get info of previous prompts but also to look into the database and gather previous history to enable more enhanced search results.

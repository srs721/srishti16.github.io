I’m Srishti - a Cloud & Data Engineer who loves building things that just work (and secretly enjoys breaking them first to figure out how).

I currently work at CGI, where I wrangle with cloud services to build intelligent systems.

Previously, I worked as DevOps engineer where CI/CD pipelines kept me very busy!
 I like solving real-world problems, whether it’s automating cloud workflows, streamlining data pipelines, or thinking about how AI can be implemented in cloud space!

I am a Computer Science graduate from Dalhousie University! Spent awesome 1.5 years learning very cool concepts like design patterns and cloud architecting! I build my own app!
  
When I’m not engineering solutions, I’m usually painting, travelling or hitting the gym!

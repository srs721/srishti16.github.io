I’m Srishti - a Cloud & Data Engineer who loves building things that just work (and secretly enjoys breaking them first to figure out how).

I currently work at CGI, where I wrangle AWS services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and Kafka to build serverless, event-driven systems.

Previously, I worked in DevOps, where CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes clusters kept me very busy (and humble). I like solving real-world problems, whether it’s automating cloud workflows, streamlining data pipelines, or thinking about how RAG pipelines in LLM can be implemented in cloud space!

When I’m not engineering solutions, I’m usually painting, travelling or hitting the gym!

Exploring and interested in building something cool!

I am a Computer Sceince graduate from Dalhousie University! Spent awesome 1.5 years learning very cool concepts like design patterns and cloud architecting!
- I built my own app!
